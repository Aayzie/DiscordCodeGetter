## Installation (Chrome)

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file.

2. Extract the folder somewhere on your PC.

3. Go to Chrome's extension page: **chrome://extensions/**

4. Click **Load unpacked**.

5. Select the folder you just extracted.

## Usage

- Use the **Game dropdown** to pick the game that forsen is playing, then click **Activate**.

- Go to [jackbox.lol](jackbox.lol) or [playwtd.com](playwtd.com), then open the **web-version of Discord** *(this doesn't work in the standalone app)*.

- If you already opened those pages before installing the extension, make sure to refresh them first (otherwise the extension won't detect them).

- Go to the text channel where you're gonna get the code from.

- The next message to be posted in that text channel will be automatically put into the game site's roomcode input field, and then the Join/Play button will be automatically "pressed" immediately after.
In other words, **you don't have to do anything**. *(Just make sure to test it first before forsen starts the game, just to make sure it works.)*

- Remember to **Deactivate** when you're not using it anymore (otherwise the extension will keep checking for new messages).
